# Ideal-Business-Location-using-REST-API

Data Science based project. The problem presented is to find the best location in Miami for a new coffee shop franchise
to start operation. Using Foursquare REST API, I determine the place with the least competitors which in my opinion should
translate in larger profits for the company. At the end I apply the KMeans clustering algorithm to cluster the neighborhoods
in Miami based on their venues to confirm my optimal location.
